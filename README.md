# Project_66
A project for Introduction to programming course in Sofia University. 
The project is an interpretation of the game Santase (66). The game runs entirely on the console.
The code revolves around the user input of commands which are validated before execution. 
All formal rules of the game are used and a few are added. 
The game can be saved to a text file and then it can be loaded from the same file. 
Warning! The game load saved games only from files generated by the game itself.
If anyone wants to try it, I hope you have a great time!
